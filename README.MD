Recently I, as the publicity secretary in our class, was asigned a task - make a poster for our class to show the basic info and spirits of students in the whole class.
It is a good chance to practice my photoshop skill, but wait!
My Ubuntu prevents me from using that commercial software and the GIMP is not an easy thing to handle... So what to do?
The answer is - make it through web programming!
Then the went on and I programmed a purely font-end web application merely for a poster and I loved it!

How to match the colors is a huge problem to me.. 

Hope you readers like it!

The images in the sceenshots folders showed my making progress..
